# Emad.Dev - Personal Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, [emad.dev](https://emad.dev). It's designed to be a clean, fast, and effective single-page showcase of my skills and experience as a Senior Mobile Developer.

## Tech Stack

This site is intentionally kept simple and robust, built with:

- **GitHub Pages:** For free, fast, and reliable hosting.
- **Jekyll:** As the underlying static site generator.
- **HTML & CSS:** For direct and precise control over the content and styling. No complex themes or frameworks are used.

## How It's Built

The entire portfolio is a single-page application. All content is managed within `index.md`, and all styling is controlled by `assets/css/style.css`. This minimalist approach ensures fast load times and easy maintenance.

### Key Files for Customization:

- `index.md`: Contains all the text content of the site, from the introduction to career highlights and projects.
- `assets/css/style.css`: Holds all the styling rules, including colors, fonts, layout, and animations.
- `_config.yml`: The main Jekyll configuration file for site-wide variables like title, description, and social links.
- `assets/images/profile.jpg`: My profile picture.
- `assets/files/Seyyed-Emad-Razavi-Resume.pdf`: My downloadable resume.

## Setting Up Your Own Version

If you'd like to use this as a template for your own portfolio:

1.  **Fork this repository.**
2.  **Update `_config.yml`** with your personal information (name, email, GitHub username, etc.).
3.  **Modify `index.md`** to reflect your own skills, experience, and projects.
4.  **Replace the files** in the `assets/` directory with your own profile picture and resume PDF.
5.  **Customize the look and feel** by editing `assets/css/style.css`.
6.  **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings. If you name your repository `{your-username}.github.io`, your site will be live at that URL.
