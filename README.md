# Description

This is the repository of [Emad.Dev](http://www.emad.dev), my personal website. The following technologies have been used for it's deployment.

1. Github pages (Create completely free open-source websites)
2. Jekyll (Static site generator, written in Ruby)
3. HTML/CSS

# Creation Steps

1. To create a similar personal site, first go to your Github website account and create a repository with your site name. I named it **emad.dev** but you may name it something else. for more information check [Creating a Github Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

2. Clone this project and update the files based on your personal needs. you may need to change **_data/settings.yml** and some resource files located at **assets**.

3. Push the project to your own repo. you can check your website on http://**{your_username}**.github.io/{**your_repo_name**}, for example, my website can be visited at [razavioo.github.io/emad.dev](http://razavioo.github.io/emad.dev)

4. (Optional) You can connect your domain to this github pages repository. I personally used [Cloudflare](http://cloudflare.com) to have a better control over my domain dns settings.

# Jekyll
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a greate library to create static sites. I suggest you to watch this great youtube tutorial on [GiraffeAcademy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) for more information.

I also used and configured the theme [kross-jekyll](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-jekyll) which is suited for my personal website use-case.
