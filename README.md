# Description

This is the repository for [Emad.dev](http://www.emad.dev), my personal website. The following technologies were used for its deployment:

1. GitHub Pages (a service that allows you to create free, open-source websites)
2. Jekyll (a static site generator written in Ruby)
3. HTML/CSS

# Creation Steps

1. To create a similar personal site, first go to your GitHub account and create a repository with your desired site name (e.g. "emad.dev"). For more information, check out [Creating a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

2. Clone this project and update the files to reflect your personal information. You may need to modify `_data/settings.yml` and some resource files located in the `assets` directory.

3. Push the project to your own repository. You can view your website at http://**{your_username}**.github.io/{**your_repo_name**} (e.g. [razavioo.github.io/emad.dev](http://razavioo.github.io/emad.dev)).

4. (Optional) You can connect your domain to this GitHub Pages repository by using a service like [Cloudflare](http://cloudflare.com) to manage your DNS settings.

# Jekyll
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a great tool for creating static sites. I recommend watching the [Giraffe Academy's YouTube tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) for more information.

I also used and configured the [kross-jekyll](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-jekyll) theme, which was well-suited for my personal website's needs.
