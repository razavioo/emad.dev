I"<p>I am Seyyed Emad Razavi, a senior Android developer. The more I grow in my specialty, the happier I become. My education was in mechanical engineering. But as time went on, I realized that I was not made for it. Gradually, I learned Android programming on my own and made a few simple games.</p>

<p>Gradually, the world became a more beautiful place. I worked in a successful accounting company in Tehran called Seyah and experienced the heavy responsibility of an Android application that had a large number of users. After that, I followed Android specialized training courses and also learned scrum management under the supervision of Mr. Hossein Taheri.</p>

<p>Some time later, I returned to my hometown, Qom, and managed several Android freelance projects, perhaps the best of which was the TaxiBoard app, which was an in-taxi smart advertising platform.</p>

<p>I felt I needed to have the experience of being in a bigger software company, so I went to one of the best companies in my city, Baslam Company. My short experience in this company, with all its bitterness and sweetness, was very valuable. I worked in the growth team. I learned a lot from ways to create business value.</p>

<p>Currently, I am implementing an Android application with very up-to-date features that will soon be available to everyone in open source. I am also learning more and more business principles by attending Aqiq Startup Studio, one of the coolest organizations I have joined. Aqiq looks like a small university for startup enthusiasts.</p>
