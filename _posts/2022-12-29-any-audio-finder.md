**Introducing Any Audio Finder, A Server-Side API for Finding Music Download Files**

Are you looking for a fast and reliable way to find download links for music files from Persian music websites? Look no further than Any Audio Finder, a new server-side API that helps you locate and download audio files from the internet.

Any Audio Finder uses web scraping and search engine APIs to search for music download files online. It stores the downloaded files in a database and provides users with a unique URL for each file, allowing them to access their downloads from any device. With Any Audio Finder, you can easily find and download music, podcasts, sound effects, and more â€“ all in one place!

Any Audio Finder was developed using the Ktor framework, a powerful open-source web application framework for the Kotlin programming language. Ktor enables the creation of scalable and reliable web apps, and is a great choice for developers who want to build high-performance applications quickly and efficiently.

The Any Audio Finder project is open source and hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/razavioo/any-audio-finder. If you're a developer interested in contributing to the project, we welcome your contributions! Whether you have ideas for new features, want to fix a bug, or just want to help out in any way, we'd love to have you join our community.

To use Any Audio Finder, simply make a request to the API with your search query and receive a response with a list of music download files. You can also filter your results by file type or source to narrow down your search.
